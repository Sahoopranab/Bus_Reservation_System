# Bus_Reservation_System

In this repository ,the code implements a basic bus reservation system that allows users to view bus lists, book tickets, cancel bookings, and check the status of available seats. It also includes a login system for user authentication. However, there are some issues and improvements that can be made, such as error handling and data storage, to make it more robust and user-friendly.
